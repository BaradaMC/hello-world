# hello-world
newbie tutorial
I'm a Comp Sci graduate (University of Manchester, 1987), who used to code professionally in PL/1 and then smallTalk.
I've decided it would be fun ('!') to learn web development, for the purposes of creating a site related to Qigong & Malaysian Ilmu.
To that end I've started working through the Mozilla Developer Network tutorials, and here I am on github creating my hello-world repository.
